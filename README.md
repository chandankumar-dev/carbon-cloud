# Carbon Cloud

Problem Statement:

Public transport emits 95% less CO2 per passenger kilometer than private vehicles and plays a crucial role in reducing traffic congestion and pollution. We aim to increase awareness of transportation's environmental impact and promote eco-friendly alternatives, particularly in car-centric communities. Our focus also includes Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.

Solution: 

Carbon Cloud is a platform to monitor your environmental impact by utilizing data from Google Maps.
A person can effortlessly upload their travel history to assess their carbon emissions. 
Reflecting on their past trips encourages people to make more eco-friendly choices. 
As a bonus, our platform recognizes environmental conscious users with blockchain NFTs through our leaderboard.
A person can earn Google Pay rewards in the form of vouchers, which can be redeemed after accumulating 1000 saved points.
